# 🌍 Lingo_Connect – Language Translation for Low-Resource Communities

**Lingo_Connect** is a modern, interactive web app designed to bridge language gaps between field officers and farmers in rural settings. Built with Nextjs, React and Tailwind CSS, it leverages Machine Translation, ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition), and TTS (Text-to-Speech) to enable real-time multilingual communication — starting with English ↔ Giriama.
